A little project using opencv-python.

This is project is just a software that will start recording whenever it detects something moving and will record a 5 seconds video for you to watch it containing the specific date and time of the event.

This program doesn't work on windows since it uses the alarm system of POSIX systems.

This program requires the opencv and numpy packages to work.
